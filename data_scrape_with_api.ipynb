There are great options on the menu, and the staff took the time to explain all the dishes, helping us make the right choice. I’m glad I visited on my first day in Colombo and I did not regret it at all. The chili and garlic crab was perfectly cooked, and the hospitality was amazing.\\n\\nA tip for future visitors: book ahead and go. Be aware that the outside seating doesn’t have rain protection, so you might have to relocate if it starts to rain. Also, there’s no AC inside, so it can get hot. Given the prices, I think these issues should be addressed. Overall, it was a good experience and worth trying at least once.',\n",

The moment we walked in, we were struck by the beautiful interiors—elegant yet inviting—and the staff, who were incredibly friendly and helpful, set the tone for a memorable dining experience.\\n\\nWe started with the Clay Pot Prawn Curry, and it was an excellent introduction to the meal. The prawns were perfectly cooked, tender with just the right amount of bite, while the curry was rich, flavorful, and comforting.\\n\\nThe real star, however, was the Butter Crab. This dish was nothing short of extraordinary. The crab was succulent and tender, and the buttery sauce was simply divine—an explosion of flavors that lingered long after the meal was over. It’s clear why this dish is so highly recommended; it’s an absolute must-try!\\n\\nWhile the restaurant may feel a bit heavy on the pocket, the quality of the food and the exceptional flavors make every penny worth it. Ministry of Crab is a culinary experience that shouldn’t be missed when in Colombo. Highly recommended for seafood lovers and anyone looking to indulge in a truly special meal.',\n",

       "    'text': 'I had an amazing experience at Ministry of Crab in Colombo! The ambiance is fantastic and the food is outstanding. There are great options on the menu, and the staff took the time to explain all the dishes, helping us make the right choice. I’m glad I visited on my first day in Colombo and I did not regret it at all. The chili and garlic crab was perfectly cooked, and the hospitality was amazing.\\n\\nA tip for future visitors: book ahead and go. Be aware that the outside seating doesn’t have rain protection, so you might have to relocate if it starts to rain. Also, there’s no AC inside, so it can get hot. Given the prices, I think these issues should be addressed. Overall, it was a good experience and worth trying at least once.',\n",

       "    'text': 'On a recent visit to Colombo, we made it a point to have lunch at the highly acclaimed Ministry of Crab, and it truly lived up to all the hype. The moment we walked in, we were struck by the beautiful interiors—elegant yet inviting—and the staff, who were incredibly friendly and helpful, set the tone for a memorable dining experience.\\n\\nWe started with the Clay Pot Prawn Curry, and it was an excellent introduction to the meal. The prawns were perfectly cooked, tender with just the right amount of bite, while the curry was rich, flavorful, and comforting.\\n\\nThe real star, however, was the Butter Crab. This dish was nothing short of extraordinary. The crab was succulent and tender, and the buttery sauce was simply divine—an explosion of flavors that lingered long after the meal was over. It’s clear why this dish is so highly recommended; it’s an absolute must-try!\\n\\nWhile the restaurant may feel a bit heavy on the pocket, the quality of the food and the exceptional flavors make every penny worth it. Ministry of Crab is a culinary experience that shouldn’t be missed when in Colombo. Highly recommended for seafood lovers and anyone looking to indulge in a truly special meal.',\n",

The food is absolutely delicious although I have wished to see the famous Godzilla but unfortunately it was not available. This is one of the best crab I have ever have it in my life. The staff also is very friendly only the girls that they put you on table should change a bit their “you have a reservation ?“ attitude. Also the place till you reach the place looks a bit uncomfy.',\n",
