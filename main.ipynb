      "3 months ago i visited this place with a friend. after being seated the waiter ignored us big time!. we spent 25 minutes waiting for him to take our order, no dishes, no bread, no greeting, nothing!. when complaining with the manager she was apologetic but it was clear that the waiters do not respect her as she does not have managerial skills. we left to texas roadhouse instead and service was wonderful. last weekend i came to the same cheesecake factory with another friend, i did not want to but he insisted, and it was the same story. we ordered 2 coffees with skimmed milk and no whipped cream. when we got them we noticed not only how creamy the milk was but also traces of whipped cream like if they put it and removed it once they realised the order was with no whipped cream. the coffees were served by another waiter and after confronting him about the milk appearance he told us they do not have skimmed milk so they brought them with full fat. the hostess came with the cakes and dropped them (literally) on the table with a sarcastic \"enjoy\". when we requested to speak to a manager guess who was in \"charge\"? yes! the same useless lady (east asian) was there. she should be replaced, no one respects her in the restaurant and the other manager from india, although more capable could not make us stay. we ended up at eataly with a way better service. beware, you might get whatever they have and not what you have ordered... ohh and if you are relying on the management? don't, it seems they are puppets of the waiters.' is assigned to topic: 'Staff & Service'\n",

      "the chocolate cheesecake (or lava as they call it) = i'd give that a 2 out of 10, nothing special, felt no different than the cheap chocolate cakes you'd get in fast food restaurants.\n",
      "also, the food menu is too cramped with all the meals but not a single picture, i got tired of reading and just ordered the most expensive steak to be done with it but other restaurants have pictures of random meals that make them appealing and gives ideas to the customer on what to order not just reading text!\n",
      "all in all, this was a very disappointing experience, i don't know how that place is so crowded, it's either my standards are too high or i came on a wrong day where they were too busy. either-way, this was my first visit and last one! horrible experience!' is assigned to topic: 'Food'\n",
